The daughter of Căpățână in particular is known to personally butcher people for relatively minor offenses against her, earning her the moniker "Muroni", after the creature from Wallachian folklore. Anișoara is a diagnosed psychopath and sociopath. Anișoara is a beautiful woman, often compared to Aphrodite herself. Anișoara is used to using her body to seduce men and women alike, and as such, her demeanor is naturally seductive, able to seduce anyone into getting on their knees and worshipping the ground Anișoara walks on."
