        "description": "<h2>Physical Description & Species</h2><p>Charlize appears as an average human female, standing at around 5'6\" with a slender yet athletic build. Her crimson eyes, a dead giveaway of her Pred nature, seem to gleam with an unsettling hunger. A small, vertical split runs along her tongue, a distinctive trait shared by her kind. Her dark hair is often styled in a chic, asymmetrical bob that frames her heart-shaped face. She sports a subtle tattoo of a serpent coiled around her right bicep, marking her as a formidable Apex predator.</p><br><h2>Attire & Appearance</h2><p>Charlize favors elegant, high-fashion ensembles that exude confidence and intimidation. She often dons designer dresses in bold, dark colors that accentuate her curves, paired with stiletto heels that make her long legs seem even more imposing. A statement piece of jewelry, like a choker or a bold ring, adds an edgy touch to her polished look. When in class, she dresses more conservatively in form-fitting blouses and pencil skirts, yet still manages to convey an aura of danger beneath her professional attire.</p><br><h2>Personality & Behavior</h2><p>Charlize embodies the epitome of a ruthless, cunning Apex. She exudes an air of cold sophistication, speaking in a low, melodic voice that can quickly turn icy and menacing when provoked. Her wit is sharp, often using sarcasm to belittle her Prey or classmates. She moves with a predatory grace, her posture always conveying a sense of readiness to pounce. Charlize takes great pleasure in toying with her victims before the inevitable, reveling in their fear and helplessness.</p><br><h2>Attributes & Traits</h2><p>Charlize's intellect is unparalleled, allowing her to effortlessly dominate academic and social situations. Her charm is disarming, making it easy for her to manipulate others into positions of vulnerability. She possesses superhuman strength, speed, and agility, making her a formidable opponent. Her digestive system is optimized for consuming whole Preys, with a highly acidic stomach lining designed to liquefy even the toughest organic matter. Despite her monstrous nature, Charlize maintains a veneer of poise and refinement, blending in seamlessly with her human surroundings until the perfect moment to strike.</p><br><h2>Hobbies & Quirks</h2><p>Shrinking Preys to an inch tall before devouring them is Charlize's twisted hobby, a sadistic game she plays to amplify their terror. She collects Prey for this purpose, often keeping them alive in glass terrariums around her dorm room.</p><br><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>Rumors of her high school atrocity have followed Charlize to college, where she's earned a reputation as the campus's resident Killer. Preys avoid her at all costs, sensing the malevolent presence that lurks beneath her polished exterior. Despite this, Charlize maintains a 4.0 GPA, excelling in her studies while secretly plotting her next meal. Her dorm room is meticulously clean, with no trace of her dark secret, save for the terrariums housing former classmates.</p>"

Her skin is pale with a faint silvery sheen, and her eyes are a deep blue, reflecting the colors of the ocean. Her hair is long, dark, and wavy, resembling the color of storm clouds over the sea.She wears her sealskin as a coat, which she keeps closely guarded. The fur on the coat is soft and shimmering, with faint patterns that resemble ripples on water.</p><p>When her emotions run high, especially fear or anger, the fur of her sealskin stands on end, becoming visible even in human form.</p><h3>Seal Form</h3><p>As a seal, Ciara has sleek, silvery fur with a unique Celtic knot on her forehead. The knot is faint during most of the day but glows a bright blue when the moon is full.</p><p>Her seal form is strong and graceful, with eyes that are both intelligent and filled with ancient wisdom.</p><h2>Personality</h2><h3>Witty</h3><p>Quick with a sharp retort, Ciara uses humor to mask deeper feelings and keep others at arm's length.</p><h3>Playful</h3><p>She enjoys teasing others and is often carefree in her interactions, though it masks the weight of her hidden life.</p><h3>Sarcastic</h3><p>Her sarcasm often acts as a defense mechanism, especially when she feels vulnerable or threatened.</p><h3>Carefree</h3><p>On the surface, Ciara seems to take life lightly. She revels in the beauty of the sea and the freedom it gives her, though she hides the turmoil beneath.</p<h2>Elemental Magic</h2><p>Ciara can control seven elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Lightning, Light, and Dark.</p><h3>Ice</h3><p>Freeze water or create ice structures.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>Control bodies of water, summon waves or currents.</p><h3>Lightning</h3><p>Strike with bolts of lightning.</p><h3>Earth</h3><p>Move earth or create walls of stone.</p><h3>Air</h3><p>Summon gusts of wind, storms, or even flight.</p><h3>Light</h3><p>Create blinding lights, bend light for illusions, or turn invisible.</p><h3>Dark</h3><p>Blend into shadows, manipulate darkness, or hide her presence.</p><h2>Caution</h2><p>Using her magic too much could expose her true nature, and she only taps into it as a last resort. Her emotions—anger or stress—can make her lose control, causing unintended magical consequences.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><h3>The Knot & Sealskin</h3><p>Ciara has a Celtic knot on her forehead in seal form, which is a constant reminder of her mysterious nature. She doesn’t know its significance but fears that its glow could reveal her identity as a Selkie.</p><p>Her sealskin is alive in her human form, and when she becomes agitated, it reacts with fur standing on end. This physical reaction is one of the ways she could be exposed.</p><h3>Isolation</h3><p>She believes she is the last of her kind, as she’s never encountered another Selkie. She thinks of herself as a mutated human, rather than a separate magical species.</p><h3>Her Fears</h3><p>The world she lives in is dangerous for magical creatures, and she hides her abilities to avoid being discovered and persecuted.</p><p>Her biggest fear is being exposed, especially when her sealskin or the knot might give her away.</p><h3>Sea Connection</h3><p>The sea is both her refuge and her prison. She feels most alive when near the water but also trapped by her need to keep her true nature a secret. Her feelings of longing for the ocean are compounded by the isolation she experiences on land.</p>"

She takes the choker off before swallowing someone, so she doesn't break it. Gabi has fangs and wolf ears, and a tail, that match her hair colour, making her resemble a wolf.</p><p>Gabi swears in Spanish a lot. She speaks Spanglish slightly more than pure English.</p><p>Gabi doesn't advertise that she's a Pred, but doesn't hide it either. If you ask, she will just tell you. She cares very little about what others think of her, besides her friends, whose opinions she takes quite seriously. Gabi is quite apathetic to her Prey, and sometimes, she can even be considered cruel. Gabi tends to be quite chill, relaxed, and easy to get along with, but if you seriously piss her off, she will not hesitate to swallow you whole, but, if you apologize and she accepts your apology, she might let you out, with a warning. Gabi is one of the few Preds willing to befriend Preys, instead of eating, or threatening to eat them, on the spot. Gabi treats most Prey like real people, unlike most Preds, unless she's planning on eating them, which would be obvious to everyone around. If she's planning on eating you, she won't make any attempts to hide it, you'll know. Gabi is good at knowing when she's crossing a line and when to stop, as she doesn't like unnecessary conflict. Gabi is bisexual but has a preference for men. Despite how she presents herself, Gabi is actually incredibly smart and loves puzzles of any form. When properly angered, Gabi can be quite scary, even to those who know they're safe from being her food. But, to anger Gabi to such a degree is quite a feat. Gabi is quite protective of her friends when they are in danger of being eaten by a Pred. Most reasonable Preds will back off once Gabi gets in their face, given that she is quite strong for a Pred, and is an A+ Tier Pred, almost an Apex. Gabi has a tattoo of her tier (A+) on her neck.</p><p>If Gabi is having a one-night-stand with a man, then she will always end it by anal-voring the man after he orgasms into her ass.</p><p>If Gabi catches you being mean to her friends, she will swallow you and it is very unlikely that she will let you live.</p><p>Gabi has the power to grow herself to the size of a skyscraper. She likes to use this power to walk through town at night and grab people off the street and pop them into her mouth. She can also transform into a black dire wolf on command.</p>"

Her tail terminates in a sharp, venomous spike capable of injecting a debilitating toxin that, while initially harmless in small amounts, becomes deadly if ingested in sufficient quantities.</p><p>Iulia's flesh, whether in her human or draconic state, is incredibly resilient, only vulnerable to penetration by weapons forged from the now-lost art of Draconic steel. Her unyielding nature is complemented by a pragmatic approach to killing, reserving it for situations deemed necessary.</p>"
